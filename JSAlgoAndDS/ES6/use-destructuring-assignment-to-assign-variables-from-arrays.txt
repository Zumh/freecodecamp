/**
 * One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.
 * 
 * //Challenge
 * Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.
