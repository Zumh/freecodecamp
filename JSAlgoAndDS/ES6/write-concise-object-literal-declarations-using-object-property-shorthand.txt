/**
 * getMousePosition is a simple function that returns an object containing two properties. ES6 provides the syntactic sugar to eliminate the redundancy of having to write x: x. You can simply write x once, and it will be converted tox: x (or something equivalent) under the hood. Here is the same function from above rewritten to use this new syntax:

const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });

//Challenges
 * Use object property shorthand with object literals to create and return an object with name, age and gender properties.
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    gender: gender
  };
 */
const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => {
  // Only change code below this line
  

  return {name, age, gender};
  // Only change code above this line
};
