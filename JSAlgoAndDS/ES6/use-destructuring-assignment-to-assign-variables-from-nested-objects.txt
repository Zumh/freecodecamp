Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables lowToday and highToday the values of today.low and today.high from the LOCAL_FORECAST object.

Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name.
const { today: {low, high}} = user;

// change this code to assign variables from nested objects

const lowToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.low;
const highToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.high;
 */
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

// Only change code below this line
  

const  {today: {low:lowToday, high:highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;

// Only change code above this line
